## Longform CV

##### Date: Sept 8, 2025

I've dropped my longform LaTeX CV here, in case the anyone wants the deep tracks. Usually I'm sending a shorter one to recruiters/application portals for the convenience of whomever (or whatever machine) may be reading it. Within those submissions, I usually provide a link to this repo in case deeper review is needed.

## What's in this one?

The full story, really - everything that's too cumbersome to put in a quick recruitment CV. This kind of content can get really over the top for fast review.

1. Academic and other honors
2. Teaching
3. Committee service
4. Selected conference appearances and abstracts

## Build it yourself?

1. he tetetete

## How about that template?

I know, it's really slick. AwesomeCV
