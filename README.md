## Longform CV

##### Version Date: Sept 8, 2025

This is my longform CV, in case the anyone wants the deep tracks. 

Usually I'm sending a shorter one to recruiters/application portals for the convenience of whomever (or whatever) may be reading it. Within those submissions, I usually provide a link to this repo in case deeper review is needed. This one is _completely generic_, so it may or may not contain details pertinent to a position the reader may be trying to fill.

## What's in this one?

The full story, really - everything that's too cumbersome to put in a quick recruitment CV. This kind of content can get really over the top for fast review.

1. Academic and other honors
1. Teaching
1. Committee service
1. Selected conference appearances and abstracts

## Build it yourself?

1. Get a TeX distribution. I like [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
2. Install Awesome-CV .cls as an external resource to your Tex distribution.
3. Build with the Makefile; it calls latexmk to deal with repeated compilation passes.
4. The PDF will appear in the base directory.
5. Otherwise, just clone what I've got here.
